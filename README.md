#Description:

<p>make a small and neat, flexible website with that lists several spells from the popular d&d 5e game appear based on searched criteria input from the user. This is useful for fans of the game and can be used as a convenient search tool for any person wanting to play a spell caster</p>

#Usage:

<p>In the website there are 3 search criteria you can choose from, spell casting class, the spell's level, and the spell school, pressing the button should bring up a listing of all the spells that fit that criteria, searching through a large json file, and clicking on the spell brings up a sub page with the spell description</p>
