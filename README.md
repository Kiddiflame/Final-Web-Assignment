#Goal:

<p>what we want to do is create a webpage based around the popular tabletop rpg DnD</p>

<p>Specifically, we will make a small website where you can look up information on the spellcaster classes in the game</p>

#Setup

<p> title and header</p>

<p> Main text</p>

<p> Search criteria include the spell caster class, the spell's level, and what school of magic it falls under(it's type), and the search button to get the spells, based on said criteria</p>

<p> Footer, my name, a constantly updating yearly date, and contact information </p>
